            =>Tailwind css for frontend design stylingand 
	    =>Redux store for backend database management
	    => Forms management - Formic librabry
	    => Router management - React-router-dom for routing
    	    => Bundler

<StrictMode>
<StrictMode> lets you find common bugs in your components early during development,
Use StrictMode to enable additional development behaviors and warnings for the component tree inside:


import { StrictMode } from 'react';
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client';

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
  <StrictMode>
    <App />
  </StrictMode>
);
